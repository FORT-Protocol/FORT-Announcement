[Announcement] Transfer of Liquidity from BSC Liquidity Pool 

Dear FORT community members, 

We would like to inform you that the part of BSC liquidity pool for DCU swap will be extracted to launch new swap pools on other chains. Details can be found below. 

1. The size of the BSC liquidity pool for the DCU-USDT swap will be proportionally decreased at 9:00 AM (GMT) on March 29, 2022. After this adjustment, the BSC liquidity pool reserves 200,000 USDTs. And the amount of reserved DCUs will be decided according to the instant reserved exchange rate of DCU-USDT in the pool when starting this adjustment.

2. The USDTs and DCUs extracted from the BSC liquidity pool will return to the account of FORT DAO. FORT DAO will gradually launch liquidity pools for DCU swap on Ethereum, Polygon, KCC, etc.
 
We have decided on this liquidity adjustment because we see potential demand for DCU from other chains and we would like to provide tradable liquidity for all DUC users.

Thank you for your support. 
The FORT Team
