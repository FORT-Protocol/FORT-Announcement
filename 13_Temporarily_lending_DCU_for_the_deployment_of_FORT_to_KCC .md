[Announcement] Temporarily lending 10,000 DCU for the deployment of FORT to KuCoin Community Chain (KCC) 

Dear FORT community members, 

We would like to inform you that to participate the KCC Unicorn Contest, FORT (and also the DCU token) will be deployed to KCC on April 16, 2022 (estimated date).

However, since the cross-chain bridge is currently not enabled, 10,000 DCU (with the total cross-chain supply 100,000,000) would be lent for the deployment. The asset would be returned as soon as the cross-chain bridge is enabled.


Thank you for your support.


The FORT Team
